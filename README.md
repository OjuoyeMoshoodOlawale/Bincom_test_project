# Bincom_test_project
This project is a demonstration of a web application that retrieves and displays polling unit results based on Local Government Area (LGA) selection. It allows users to select an LGA from a dropdown menu and dynamically fetches the corresponding polling unit results via AJAX, presenting them in a tabular format.
